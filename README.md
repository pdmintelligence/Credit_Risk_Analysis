# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The module 17 challenge pertained to the topic of measuring and assessing credit risk. The nature of credit risk is inherently unbalanced, such that the data is heavily skewed to neutral or positive ratings and away from bad ratings. This creates a problem as the sample of the data is biased. The goal of hte module is to use a variety of statistical and data techniques such as logistic regression and machine learning to assess credit risk using a fictitious dataset of loan applicant information.

We constructed and tested several different models of credit risk using a variety of sampling techniques to account for this bias. The different types of models are detailed below:
